Title
Todo Application with Basic CRUD Operations

Objective
Learn how to design and build a simple full stack application that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. Understand the basic flow of storing, retrieving, and managing data in a database.

Task Description
Build a todo application (e.g., using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express + MongoDB or any database for the backend). Implement functionality to:

Add new todo items
Display the list of existing todos
Update todo items (e.g., mark as completed)
Delete items from the list
Use simple styling to make the UI clear and user-friendly. Test your application by adding, editing, and removing todos, and ensure data updates correctly in the database.

Expected Output
A working web app where users can manage their todo items.
Fully functional CRUD backend connected to a database.
Clear, user-friendly interface to view and interact with todos.
